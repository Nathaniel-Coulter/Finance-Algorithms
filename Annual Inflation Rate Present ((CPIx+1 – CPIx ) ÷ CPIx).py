#Basic calculation of the annual inflation rate using the CPI (Consumer Price Index)
#The day I'm posting this on github is 2/9/2024...
# Current CPI = 3.4% | One year ago today CPI = 6.5%

    Our Parameters:
    current_cpi (float): The current CPI value.
    previous_cpi (float): The previous CPI value.
    
    Return:
    (float): The annual inflation rate.
